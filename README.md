Phonebook
=========

Exercise: telephone directory web application for XPeppers

I write my app only with javascript, there is nothing to configure, but take care to run it in a browser that supports html5 with js active.

Files
----
-	phonebook.js	contains the heart of application;
-	app.js			contains functions for DOM interactions;
-	index.html		html structure;
-	style.css		css rules;

You do not need anything else.

Features

	You can upload a json file with your personal phonebook. You can choose between *replace* or *import*. The first will erase all data and replace them with new ones. The second will add the new data to those already present.
	If your browser support Local Storage the data will be load at the start from there.
